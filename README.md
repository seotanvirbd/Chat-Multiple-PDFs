# Q&A with Multiple PDFs | Conversational RAG | Langchain and Streamlit | Free Way

Welcome to the **Q&A with Multiple PDFs** project! This application allows users to upload multiple PDFs and ask questions about the content. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and the **Google Gemini LLM**, the app intelligently answers questions based on both the PDF information and the LLM's knowledge base. The project is built with **Langchain** and **Streamlit**, providing a free and interactive way to work with documents.

## üöÄ Features
- **Upload Multiple PDFs**: Users can upload several PDFs and chat with the information contained within them.
- **Conversational AI**: The app can answer questions based on the PDFs and continue the conversation seamlessly.
- **Powered by RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines document retrieval with LLM responses, ensuring accurate answers.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A clean and easy-to-use interface with real-time interactivity.
- **Google Gemini LLM**: Integration with Google's Gemini model for robust and accurate language generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Langchain**: For building LLM-driven applications.
- **Google Gemini LLM**: The language model powering the conversational capabilities.
- **Chroma**: Vector store for embedding and retrieval.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.

## üìù Project Overview
This project demonstrates the power of combining multiple PDFs with LLMs to create an interactive, knowledge-based chat application. Users can upload multiple PDFs and ask questions about their content. The app retrieves the most relevant information from the PDFs using vector embeddings and augments the response with LLM-generated knowledge.

The app is designed to provide accurate and conversational responses, making it suitable for various use cases such as research, document analysis, and more.

## üìÑ Example Use Cases
- **Research Assistance**: Upload research papers and ask questions to quickly gather insights.
- **Document Analysis**: Get a summarized understanding of contracts, legal documents, or any text-based content.
- **Study Aid**: Upload textbooks and ask questions to reinforce learning.
